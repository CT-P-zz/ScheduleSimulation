# ScheduleSimulation

In this work, we aim to quantitatively assess the improvement of having walk-in patients in a capacity allocation solution for imaging devices through the analysis of an appointment system combining walk-ins and appointments that maximizes the number of walk-in patients. We analyse the case study of the CT-scanning at the radiotherapy department of the AVL. To this end, we use a ‘Walk-in Generator’ model
[1] to obtain a capacity allocation solution for the two types of patients, which was quantitatively evaluated through a discreteevent simulation model
